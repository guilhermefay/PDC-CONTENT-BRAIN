      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks covering: (1) data pipeline setup for content categorization, (2) LLM-based analysis module development, (3) extraction of structural and stylistic patterns, (4) report generation with statistical and qualitative insights, (5) design and implementation of a human validation interface, (6) transformation of validated guidelines for copywriting agent integration, and (7) comprehensive documentation of the process and integration points.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the number of components, the need for advanced LLM integration, multi-stage data processing, human-in-the-loop validation, and downstream impact on other systems. Each step involves distinct technical and UX challenges, requiring careful coordination and robust testing. The task's scope spans data engineering, NLP, interface design, and system integration, justifying a high complexity score and a detailed subtask breakdown.[4][5]"

      "taskTitle": "Refactor GDrive Ingestion for Incremental, Per-File Processing and Immediate Chunk Storage",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the task into subtasks including: (1) refactoring the ingestion script for per-file processing and immediate chunk storage, (2) updating chunk status tracking and processed files logic, (3) modifying the pipeline to fetch pending chunks from Supabase, (4) implementing robust error handling and resumability, and (5) coordinating with related tasks for per-chunk status consistency.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately high in complexity due to the need for significant refactoring, transactional logic to ensure data integrity, robust error handling, and coordination with other pipeline components. While the technical scope is narrower than Task 37, it still requires careful design to ensure reliability and maintainability, warranting multiple subtasks for clarity and risk mitigation.[4][5]"
